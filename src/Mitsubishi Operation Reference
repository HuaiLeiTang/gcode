Robot can be moved in separate modes
- Joint: Rotation around J1-J6
- XYZ: Moving along coordinates, automatically rotating the joints
    - ABC: Rotating tool around control point (set tool length in parameters, default = 0)
    - XYZ456?
    - Cylinder: Y-> arc
- Tool: Move along tool coordinate system (e.g. xyz, tool orientation is preserved)

MELFA-Basic IV
- Robot operation control:
    MOV (joint interpolation)
    MVS (linear interpolation)
    MVR, MVR2, MVR3, MVC (circular interpolation)
    CNT (continuous movement)
    ACCEL, OADL (Acc/dec time and SC)
    FINE, MOV and DLY (confirm target pos reached)
    PREC (High accuracy ctrl)
    HOPEN, HCLOSE, TOOL (hand and tool ctrl)
- Program control:
    GOTO, IF THEN ELSE, WAIT, ETC. (branching, waiting)
    FOR NEXT, WHILE WEND (Repetition)
    DEF ACT, ACT (Interrupt)
    DLY (Timer)
    END (Stopping)
